**Activities and lessons learned:**

**Laura Cromwell**: I did part 4c, integrating forensics. I created a logging object and found 5 methods within graphtaint.py to add forensics to where files were read and data structures were accessed. I learned that logging is important to track when resources were accessed or updated to keep your software secure. 

**Brooke Hopton-Jones**: I did part 4a - creating a Git Hook that runs and reports all security weaknesses into gitHook.csv. The file has reports of 17 security weaknessses between the constants.py, parser.py, and TEST_CONSTANTS.py files. These files contain security implications with subprocesses and possible hardcoded passwords. I was able to learn the importance of Git Hooks and recording security weaknesses through this project.
