**Activities and lessons learned:**

**Laura Cromwell**: I did part 4c, integrating forensics. I created a logging object and found 5 methods within graphtaint.py to add forensics to where files were read and data structures were accessed. I learned that logging is important to track when resources were accessed or updated to keep your software secure.
